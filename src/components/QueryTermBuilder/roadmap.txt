QueryTermBuilder - operatorWithLabels
  should only be in the form {id:string, lable:string}
  do away with short/long
  make sure the labels can change dynamically (spanish, thai, etc)
  make sure the labels can change dynamically short (=, >=, ...) and long ('Equals' 'Greater Than')
  
-- done - QueryTermBuilder - create Object (not type) of Ops supportedOps {$eq:'$eq', '$gt':'$gt' ... }
-- done - use that when a 'type' wont do (mostly for testing)
  find when/where to replace with AllOperators

-- Add opps $nregex and $neq (not) - Probably shouldn't be too difficult.
   Now I need to make forward progress.
